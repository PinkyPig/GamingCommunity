KyngaCell, one of the leaders in mobile gaming, introduced a new online community feature for their
latest game, Nicht-Soporific. To test the effectiveness and impact of the online community, we sought to
determine and quantify if it improved user revenue and retention within the game along with an increase
in customer lifetime value (CLV). The data provided details of individuals who play the game, who
participate in the community, spending by gamers one month prior and subsequent to the release of the
online community, customer age, and acquisition method (Campaign/Organic) for each user.
Upon analyzing the data, we concluded that:

● The online community resulted in increased revenue. The mean revenue for users who joined the
online community increased by $29 as compared to the ones who did not join.

● The online community did not lead to increased retention. The retention rate for users who joined
the community was less than that for those who did not join.

● The online community feature had a positive ef ect on CLV. The average CLV for users who
joined the program increased by $9 in contrast to the ones who did not.

● The effect of the customer acquisition method on CLV is inconclusive. There was no significant
difference in the CLV between the users who joined the program organically and those who
joined as a result of the campaign.

In the end, the success of a new feature does not depend on how well it is marketed but on how well it
addresses a user’s needs. Even though findings suggest a review of marketing & customer retention
strategies, a more comprehensive approach to collecting data pertaining to acquisition cost and user
demographics is required to arrive at more meaningful conclusions.
